**Code Golf** | "As few lines of code as possible."
**Monolith** | "No named abstractions. No, or little, use of libraries."
**Kick Forward** | "Each function takes an additional parameter, usually the last, which is another function. That function parameter is applied at the end of the current function. That function parameter is given, as input, what would be the output of the current function. The larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions, but where the next function to be applied is given as parameter to the current function."
**Inifinite Mirror** | "All, or a significant part, of the problem is modeled using induction. That is, specify the base case (n0) and then the n + 1 rule."
